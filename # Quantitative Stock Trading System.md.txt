# Quantitative Stock Trading System Plan
*(Context-Aware, Event-Aware, Math-Driven)*

## 1. Core Objective

Design and build a **math-driven, emotionally neutral stock trading system** that:

- Removes gut-based decision making
- Uses quantitative logic and historical evidence
- Runs continuously in the background (cloud-hosted)
- Provides **real-time alerts** when meaningful conditions arise
- Supports both:
  - Short-term opportunities
  - Long-term capital growth
- Is responsible, ethical, and risk-aware
- Is ready for cautious live deployment around **mid-January**
- Prioritizes **decision support over blind automation**

Initial capital target: **~$1,000**, deployed gradually.

The system is meant to **inform and assist decisions**, not act as an unsupervised trading bot.

---

## 2. Guiding Philosophy

- Humans are emotional
- Math is consistent
- Discipline beats vibes

This system explicitly avoids:
- “Black box” hype
- Over-automation without safeguards
- Claims of perfect prediction

**Framing:**  
> This is a **radar system**, not an autopilot.

---

## 3. Technology Direction

### Language
- **Python (preferred)**
  - Industry standard for quantitative finance
  - Strong ecosystem for:
    - Data analysis
    - Statistics
    - Backtesting
    - NLP / sentiment analysis
  - Easier iteration and research than Java

### Hosting
- **Cloud-based execution**
  - Runs 24/7 without a personal computer
  - Supports scheduled jobs and background processes
  - Replit initially; VPS later if needed

### Broker Integration
- **Alpaca API**
  - Paper trading first
  - Live trading only after extended validation
  - Broker execution is required for any real trades

## 4. System Architecture (Three-Layer Model)

### Layer 1 — Market Data & Technical Analysis

Baseline quantitative layer.

Includes:
- Historical and near-real-time price data
- Volume, volatility, momentum
- Technical indicators:
  - RSI
  - Moving averages
  - Trend filters
- Regime detection (risk-on vs risk-off)

Purpose:
- Identify statistically meaningful patterns
- Define trade candidates
- Measure and monitor edge

---

### Layer 2 — News & Legislation Awareness (Context Layer)

Adds real-world context beyond price action.

#### News Analysis
- Scan financial and sector-specific news
- Track:
  - Frequency spikes
  - Sentiment (positive / negative / uncertainty)
  - Narrative novelty (new vs repeated themes)
- Associate topics with impacted sectors or symbols

Example:
> Regulatory news volume increases sharply before price reacts.

---

#### Legislative & Policy Monitoring
- Track pending legislation and regulatory actions
- Monitor:
  - Bill introductions
  - Committee movement
  - Floor votes
  - Executive or agency actions
- Keyword and topic tagging:
  - “Ban”
  - “Subsidy”
  - “Tax”
  - “Restriction”
  - “Mandate”
- Map bills to impacted sectors and industries

Key insight:
> Markets often price **probability shifts**, not final outcomes.

Purpose:
- Detect rising uncertainty
- Identify policy-driven regime changes
- Add risk context before price moves

---

### Layer 3 — Decision Logic & Alerts

This layer synthesizes Layers 1 and 2.

Responsibilities:
- Modify confidence in technical signals based on context
- Flag elevated-risk environments
- Suppress or downgrade signals during:
  - Policy shocks
  - Narrative regime shifts
- Trigger alerts when:
  - Technical + contextual conditions align
  - Risk thresholds are breached
  - Historical analogs suggest instability

Important rule:
- News and legislation **modify** decisions
- They do **not blindly override price data**

---

## 5. Historical Alignment & Learning

The system should evaluate historical parallels:

- When similar legislation appeared:
  - Price response
  - Volatility changes
- When similar news narratives emerged:
  - Trend continuation vs reversal
  - Correlation shifts
- Duration and decay of effects

Goal:
- Probabilistic reasoning
- Better exits than entries
- Reduced surprise risk

---

## 6. Execution Strategy (Phased & Responsible)

### Phase 1 — Research & Backtesting
- No live money
- Validate strategies on historical data
- Stress-test assumptions

### Phase 2 — Paper Trading
- Simulated execution via Alpaca
- Continuous monitoring for weeks
- Stability and discipline verification

### Phase 3 — Limited Live Deployment
- Small initial allocation
- Strict risk controls
- Alerts prioritized over automation
- Gradual scaling only if live behavior matches expectations

---

## 7. What This System Is Not

This system is **not**:
- A high-frequency trading bot
- A meme-stock chaser
- A guaranteed profit engine
- An unsupervised AI money printer

It **is**:
- A disciplined, context-aware market intelligence platform

---

## 8. Ethical & Personal Alignment

The system aligns with:
- Financial independence without exploitation
- Transparency and responsibility
- Long-term thinking
- Using resources to help others, not merely accumulate wealth

---

## 9. Final Framing

> **This system is a radar, not an autopilot.**

It does not make life decisions.
It warns when storms are forming — often before they are visible.
